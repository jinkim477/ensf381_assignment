/*
    - CartItem comopnent represents an individual item in the cart.
      The CartItem component will render this product with its associated
      details when "Add to Cart" is clicked, as specified earlier in the
      assignment. This component will display the product image, name, price,
      quantity, and total price of a product. For example, if Product 1 has a
      quantity of 2 and unit price of $10, the total price would display a value
      of $20. Also, if you click the "Add to Cart" of a product that is already
      in the cart, the quantity of that product will be increased by 1 instead of
      creating a new CartItem component.

    - Include and display a button named "Remove" with this component. Clicking the
      button will decrease the quantity of the product by 1. When the quantity becomes
      0, the item will be removed from the cart.
